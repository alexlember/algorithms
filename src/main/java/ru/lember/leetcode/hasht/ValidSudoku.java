/**
 * Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:
 *
 * Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
 * Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
 * Each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
 *
 * A partially filled sudoku which is valid.
 *
 * The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character '.'.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input:
 * [
 *   ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
 *   ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
 *   [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
 *   ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
 *   ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
 *   ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
 *   [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
 *   [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
 *   [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
 * ]
 * Output: true
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input:
 * [
 *   ["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
 *   ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
 *   [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
 *   ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
 *   ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
 *   ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
 *   [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
 *   [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
 *   [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
 * ]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being
 *     modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
 * Note:
 *
 * A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
 * Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
 * The given board contain only digits 1-9 and the character '.'.
 * The given board size is always 9x9.
